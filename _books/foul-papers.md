A quietly combustible literary thriller about love, art and the prices we pay for both. Foul Papers follows tangled lives across country houses and newsrooms: a celebrated poet guarding his vanished past, a celebrity torn between ambition and conscience, a young coder with a scholar’s hunger for truth. Eamonn Vincent conjures a world of hedged gardens, smoky pubs and slick PR machines where memory, authorship and secrecy collide—stitching elegiac lyricism to razor‑sharp satire.

Atmosphere: intimate, elegiac, occasionally vicious. Themes: plagiarism and provenance, power and vulnerability, desire and reinvention. Style: literate, conversational, keen on moral complexity—dialogue that crackles, prose that savours small domestic detail and big ethical quandaries. Emotionally, the book moves from wry amusement to tender regret, delivering both relish and ache.

Perfect for readers of contemporary literary suspense and cultural critique, Foul Papers asks who owns a life’s work—and what we do when the past resurfaces. Written in British English with a wry, erudite style and an emphasis on character and atmosphere, this is a novel that will haunt your thoughts long after the last page. Ready to be drawn in?
