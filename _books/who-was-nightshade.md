In the sun-drowsed lanes of rural Hertfordshire, old money is fraying, loyalties are negotiable, and the Cold War has found a quiet place to hide.

WHO WAS NIGHTSHADE? drops you into 1963 with a deliciously tense blend of espionage, country-house unease, and small-town scrutiny. A Whitehall man arrives under a polished cover story; a cash-strapped heir clings to tradition and survival; a fiercely curious pair of teenagers test the boundaries of adulthood; and an eccentric inventor’s “impossible” machine hums with unanswered questions.

Eamonn Vincent writes with crisp, wryly observant style—sharp dialogue, slow-burn dread, and a sensual, summery atmosphere that turns golden fields and pub corners into places of danger. Beneath the charm: class, secrecy, desire, betrayal, and the cost of knowing too much.

In Fordham Market, everyone has a role to play—so who, exactly, is Nightshade…and what are they willing to erase to keep that name from becoming a face?
