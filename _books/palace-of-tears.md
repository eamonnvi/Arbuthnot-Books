Palace of Tears is a lush, razor‑bright novel of desire, deception and the private costs of public lives. Set between Cambridge and a divided 1970s Berlin, Eamonn Vincent weaves academic wit, theatre glamour and Cold War menace into a story about lovers who bargain with bodies, fathers who keep secrets, and the small betrayals that become historical breaches.

Atmosphere: damp Fenland mornings, smoky rehearsal rooms, the humming dread of border crossings—Vincent renders place as character, every room charged with memory and risk. Themes of power, class, art and parenthood move the narrative with quiet insistence; the novel is as much about who tells a story as about what the story costs.

Style: elegantly observant, wry and unsparing, Palace of Tears balances classical literary command with sharp, contemporary dialogue. It is intimate and epic at once—poignant in grief, mischievous in romance, uncompromising in moral complexity.

For readers of literary suspense and uncompromising character drama: a novel that lingers long after the last page.
